  abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}An adaptive learning system aims at providing instruction tailored to the current status of a learner, differing from the traditional classroom experience. The latest advances in technology make adaptive learning possible, which has the potential to provide students with high-quality learning benefit at a low cost. A key component of an adaptive learning system is a recommendation system, which recommends the next material (video lectures, practices, and so on, on different skills) to the learner, based on the psychometric assessment results and possibly other individual characteristics. An important question then follows: How should recommendations be made? To answer this question, a mathematical framework is proposed that characterizes the recommendation process as a Markov decision problem, for which decisions are made based on the current knowledge of the learner and that of the learning materials. In particular, two plain vanilla systems are introduced, for which the optimal recommendation at each stage can be obtained analytically.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract = {Dynamic treatment recommendation systems based on large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) become a key to successfully improve practical clinical outcomes. Prior relevant studies recommend treatments either use supervised learning (e.g. matching the indicator signal which denotes doctor prescriptions), or reinforcement learning (e.g. maximizing evaluation signal which indicates cumulative reward from survival rates). However, none of these studies have considered to combine the benefits of supervised learning and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning with Recurrent Neural Network (SRL-RNN), which fuses them into a synergistic learning framework. Specifically, SRL-RNN applies an off-policy actor-critic framework to handle complex relations among multiple medications, diseases and individual characteristics. The "actor" in the framework is adjusted by both the indicator signal and evaluation signal to ensure effective prescription and low mortality. RNN is further utilized to solve the Partially-Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem due to the lack of fully observed states in real world applications. Experiments on the publicly real-world dataset, i.e., MIMIC-3, illustrate that our model can reduce the estimated mortality, while providing promising accuracy in matching doctors' prescriptions.},

  abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The utilization of reinforcement learning (RL) within the field of education holds the potential to bring about a significant shift in the way students approach and engage with learning and how teachers evaluate student progress. The use of RL in education allows for personalized and adaptive learning, where the difficulty level can be adjusted based on a student’s performance. As a result, this could result in heightened levels of motivation and engagement among students. The aim of this article is to investigate the applications and techniques of RL in education and determine its potential impact on enhancing educational outcomes. It compares the various policies induced by RL with baselines and identifies four distinct RL techniques: the Markov decision process, partially observable Markov decision process, deep RL network, and Markov chain, as well as their application in education. The main focus of the article is to identify best practices for incorporating RL into educational settings to achieve effective and rewarding outcomes. To accomplish this, the article thoroughly examines the existing literature on using RL in education and its potential to advance educational technology. This work provides a thorough analysis of the various techniques and applications of RL in education to answer questions related to the effectiveness of RL in education and its future prospects. The findings of this study will provide researchers with a benchmark to compare the usefulness and effectiveness of commonly employed RL algorithms and provide direction for future research in education.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Both the historical basis    of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized.    Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns    behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic    environment.  The work described here has a resemblance to work in    psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of    the word ``reinforcement.''  The paper discusses central issues of    reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and    exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov    decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing    empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization    and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state.  It concludes with a    survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical    utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},
